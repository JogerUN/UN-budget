<!--
HOW TO USE THIS TEMPLATE
------------------------
1. Copy this file to docs/design/01_Architectural_and_Detailed_Design.md in your team repository.
2. This is v1.0 of work you already started: your Class 11 "Architectural Hypothesis v0.1"
   and your Class 12 "Detailed Design v0.1". Extend them to your whole system. Do not restart.
3. Use YOUR project. Generic examples (e-commerce, food delivery, banking, library) are
   only reference material and cannot be submitted as project artifacts.
4. Fill in every section. If something genuinely does not apply, write "N/A: reason".
   Never invent content to fill a blank.
5. Every diagram needs the table or argument that explains it. A diagram records design
   decisions. It does not create them.
6. Diagrams: Mermaid is preferred because it renders on GitHub. PlantUML or another tool is
   accepted if the exported image is committed and embedded in this file.
   Optionally, also add a JPG of each diagram in docs/design/diagrams/ (the Markdown prevails if they differ).
7. Read Design_Deliverable_1_Example.md for the expected level of detail. Do not copy it.

# [Project Name] — Architectural & Detailed Design v1.0

| | |
|---|---|
| **Team** | |
| **Members** | |
| **Status** | Draft / Ready for review |
| **Date** | |
| **Inputs** | `docs/requirements/`, Architectural Hypothesis v0.1 (Class 11), Detailed Design v0.1 (Class 12) |

---

## 1. System Overview & Design Drivers

**System purpose** (2–3 sentences, in terms of the need it satisfies)
>

**Requirements that shape the structure** *(the ones that most influence the design, not all of them)*

| Requirement / Use Case ID | Why it shapes the structure | Quality attribute, constraint or business rule involved |
|---|---|---|
| | | |

---

## 2. Architectural Design

*(Outward-facing: what are the major parts, what is each responsible for, how do they interact?)*

### 2.1 System Context & Boundary

| Outside the system | Type (actor / external system / hardware) | How the system interacts with it |
|---|---|---|
| | | |

### 2.2 Components, Responsibilities & Capabilities

Cover the principal functional scope of your whole system.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Actor([User or external actor])
    subgraph SYS["System name"]
        C1["Component 1"]
        C2["Component 2"]
        C3["Component 3"]
    end
    Ext[("External system")]

    Actor --> C1
    C1 -->|"capability requested"| C2
    C2 -->|"capability requested"| C3
    C3 -->|"capability requested"| Ext
```

*(Everything inside `SYS` is what you build and control. Everything outside is what you only interact with. Label each arrow with the capability being requested.)*

| Component | Main responsibility | Requirements / use cases supported | Provided capabilities | Required capabilities | Main dependencies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | | | |

*Checks: is every component named by responsibility, not technology ("the component that persists orders", not "the database")? Does any component exist only to make the diagram look more complex?*

---

## 3. Detailed Design

*(Inward-facing: how is each selected component designed internally?)*

### 3.1 Components selected (at least two)

| Component | Why it was selected (risk, complexity, centrality to the drivers) |
|---|---|
| | |

### 3.2 Class Diagram(s)

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class ClassA {
        -attribute : Type
        +operation(param : Type) ReturnType
    }
    class ClassB {
        -attribute : Type
        +operation() ReturnType
    }
    class ClassC {
        +operation() ReturnType
    }

    ClassA "1" *-- "0..*" ClassB : contains
    ClassA "1" --> "1" ClassC : uses
```

*(Visibility: `-` private, `+` public. Relationships: `-->` association, `*--` composition (the part cannot exist without the whole), `<|--` generalization (a specialized type of). Add multiplicity in quotes. Use composition or generalization only when their meaning is justified. Do not force them.)*

### 3.3 Class Responsibilities

| Class | Component it belongs to | Responsibility | Key collaborators |
|---|---|---|---|
| | | | |

*(Every class must belong to an identifiable component. Do not replace the component diagram with one large class diagram.)*

### 3.4 Behavior of one key operation

*(The operation you designed in Class 12, or a more important one. At most about 15 lines. Include at least one non-happy path.)*

## 4. Design Quality — Cohesion, Coupling, Information Hiding

| Question | Your answer, with evidence from your design |
|---|---|
| **Cohesion:** do the responsibilities inside each class or component belong together? | |
| **Coupling:** how far does a change in one element spread? Where are the strongest dependencies? | |
| **Information hiding:** what did you keep private or internal, and why? | |

**At least one real finding** (a problem you found in your own design) **and what you changed or would change:**
>

## 5. Design Decisions & Decision Record

Two decisions are required: one architectural (Class 11 level) and one detailed-design (Class 12 level). Avoid "it is best practice", "it scales" or "it is cleaner" without project evidence.

### Decision A — Architectural

| **Section** | **Details** |
|:---|:---|
| **Context** | Under the requirements established in **REQ-06** (*Comparative Analysis and Visualization - Dashboard*), the system must provide processed financial summaries to generate and render the various dashboard charts. This information originates from the finance repository; however, the presentation layer (UI) must not perform these aggregation and calculation operations. |
| **Decision** | We decided to create an isolated component **(Balance Manager)** responsible for retrieving raw persistent financial data from the repository, modeling it, and computing the financial metrics consumed by the dashboard. This prevents the UI from executing domain calculations and eliminates logic duplication and data inconsistencies. |
| **Rationale** | **Consistency:** Centralizing metric calculations in a dedicated component relieves the UI of responsibilities outside its scope, establishing a single, purpose-built location to enforce calculation rules.<br><br>**Integrity and Performance:** Instead of transmitting hundreds of individual transactions to the browser, the system aggregates them on the server and returns only the consolidated values and structures needed by the charts.<br><br>**Persistence Isolation:** Schema changes or structural adjustments within the persistence engine (PostgreSQL) remain isolated in the repository and do not affect the dashboard interface. |
| **Trade-off accepted** | **Transformation Overhead and Intermediate Latency:** An obligatory intermediate hop is introduced between the presentation layer and the repositories, requiring explicit Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) and mappers to translate transactional entities into chart-ready summaries.<br><br>**Rejected Alternative:** We rejected allowing `Dashboard UI` to query transactions directly and calculate balances within the client browser. Although that alternative would have reduced initial backend development effort, it exposed the system to calculation errors in the client. |

### Decision B — Detailed design

| | |
|---|---|
| **Context** | |
| **Decision** | |
| **Rationale** | |
| **Trade-off accepted** | |

### ADR

At least one of the two decisions above must also be recorded as an ADR (use `Plantilla_ADR_Nygard`) in `docs/decisions/`.

**ADR file:** `docs/decisions/ADR-XXX-title.md` — records Decision [A / B].

---

## 6. Traceability

| Requirement ID | Use Case | Component(s) | Class(es) |
|---|---|---|---|
| | | | |

*(Every requirement in Section 1 must appear. Every component and class should appear at least once. If an element traces to nothing, ask why it exists.)*

---

## 7. Optional — AI-Assisted Design Reflection

> One design recommendation generated by AI that the team accepted, modified or rejected, and why.

---

## 8. Consistency Checklist

- [ ] Every component in the diagram appears in the responsibilities table, and the other way around.
- [ ] Every class belongs to an identifiable component.
- [ ] Components are named by responsibility, not technology.
- [ ] Nothing inside the system boundary is something you do not control.
- [ ] Provided and required capabilities match across components (what one requires, another provides).
- [ ] Both decisions name a real cost or limitation, and at least one has an ADR.
- [ ] The traceability table has no empty rows and no orphan components or classes.
- [ ] Diagrams render correctly on GitHub (or the exported images are embedded).
